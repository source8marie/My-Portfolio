                                I led our team in developing a planner application prototype entitled the Tokyo Planner. 
                                As the name suggests, its purpose is to help the user build his/her itinerary as a guide while in Tokyo, Japan. 
                                Once I thought of its design and framework, we then narrowed down the scope to focus on a certain area. <br><br>
                                In this context, Tokyo is commonly visited by tourists hence our team was able to research 
                                and include popular spots, restaurants, transportation, and lodging; wherein the user is able to schedule, 
                                find a place, reserve, and note reminders with our application.
